# Fushigi

## About

Fushigi is a homage to the classic Chunsoft game series 不思議のダンジョン, or  [Mystery Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Dungeon).

Mystery Dungeon is an early entry in the Roguelike genre, which should match well with the ephemeral nature of the web.

## Tech

Fushigi is written in TypeScript, with a custom built game engine.
